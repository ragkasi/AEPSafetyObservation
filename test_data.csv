Particularly, large diameter trunks are being felled and processed within the limitations ( generally, and on this site ) an MS271 type 50cc ( approx ) farm and ranch saw. It is well known that bar length selection, which implies a sufficient powerband, is an aspect of developing a 5s - tep felling plan. In particular, saws not optimized to the task increase risk exposure by decreasing the sawyer's options for work positioning in relation to the escape routes, increasing time at the periphery of the back - cut ( thus exposure in the immediate barberchair / butt kickback potential area ), increasing the likelihood of kerf misalignment due to the need to wrap around, and increasing heat transfer to the working components during a vital point of performance. Insufficient bar length and sufficient, but not optimized power bands increase the difficulty for the sawyer, especially those less experience, in creating the face cut architecture. Extended dwell times during debris processing also increase exposure rates while increasing T & M costs. [NAME] uppercanopy branches are currently serviced with domestic grade equipment, and while posing a different operational consideration, some points related to control, heat, and exposure time apply. It is recommended that equipment fielding be assessed and equipment, such as professional grade chainsaws, be fielded in support of large removal operations in a manner similar to commercial, municipal, and federal tree professionals in similar operating environments executing similar tasks.",,immediate safety fault recommendation reduce overall operator exposure noted crew crews executing large diameter dbx removals domestic farm ranch grade chainsaws lieu professional grade equipment particularly large diameter trunks felled processed within limitations generally site ms type cc approx farm ranch saw well known bar length selection implies sufficient powerband aspect developing tep felling plan particular saws optimized task increase risk exposure decreasing sawyers options work positioning relation escape routes increasing time periphery back cut thus exposure immediate barberchair butt kickback potential area increasing likelihood kerf misalignment due need wrap around increasing heat transfer working components vital point performance insufficient bar length sufficient optimized power bands increase difficulty sawyer especially less experience creating face cut architecture extended dwell times debris processing also increase exposure rates increasing costs name uppercanopy branches currently serviced domestic grade equipment posing different operational consideration points related control heat exposure time apply recommended equipment fielding assessed equipment professional grade chainsaws fielded support large removal operations manner similar commercial municipal federal tree professionals similar operating environments executing similar tasks
